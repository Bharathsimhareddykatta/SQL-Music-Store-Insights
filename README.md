#  SQL Music Store Insights

This repository contains a portfolio-style project that uses SQL to explore and analyze a digital music store’s database. By crafting meaningful queries, we uncover insights related to sales, customers, genres, and store performance.

---

##  Project Overview

This exploration of a Music Store database aims to answer business-relevant questions such as:
- Which countries generate the most revenue?
- Who are the top-paying customers?
- Which music genres and artists are most popular?
- What sales trends and invoice patterns emerge?

The project serves as both a learning tool for SQL and a showcase of analytical thinking with real-world style data.

##  Contents of the Repository

- **`datasets/`** – Raw dataset files for loading into your SQL environment.
- **`MusicDatabaseSchema.png`** – A visual depiction of table relationships in the database.
- **`analysis.sql`** – SQL queries designed to extract insights from the data.
- **`music_store_db_backup`** – A full backup file for quick restoration of the database.
- **`music_store_db_query.txt`** – A reference list of the main SQL queries used.
- **`README.md`** – This documentation file you’re reading now.

---

##  Getting Started

1. Install a suitable DBMS (e.g., **PostgreSQL**).
2. Restore the database using the backup or import data from the `datasets/` folder.
3. Open and execute the queries in `analysis.sql` to generate insights.
4. Refer to the schema diagram for context about your database's structure.

##  Tools & Technologies

- **SQL (PostgreSQL recommended)**
- SQL IDEs: *PgAdmin*, *DBeaver*, or any SQL client you prefer

---

##  Highlights & Insights

- The **United States** leads in total invoice count.
- **Rock** is the most frequently purchased genre.
- You can pinpoint high-spending customers—ideal for marketing strategies.
- Query results reveal which employees occupy senior roles.

---

##  Learning Objectives

- Strengthen SQL query-writing using joins, aggregations, subqueries, and window functions
- Interpret and understand database schemas via diagrams
- Translate business questions into SQL-driven answers

##  Inspiration & Acknowledgments

This project was inspired by the YouTube tutorial **"Data Analyst Portfolio Project – Music Store Data Analysis Project using SQL"**, which provides a full end-to-end walkthrough—from setting up the database to extracting business-style insights. You can watch it here:

##  Future Improvements (Ideas)

- Integrate **Power BI** or **Tableau** dashboards to visualize query outputs
- Showcase sample result snapshots or charts in the README
- Add more complex SQL queries (e.g., cohort analysis, customer segmentation)
